## 🔄 COMPLETE DATA FLOW IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. EXTRACTION FLOW (Products & Services)
**Route**: `POST /api/admin/companies/{company_id}/extract`

**Backend → AI Service → Qdrant Flow:**
```
1. Backend uploads file to R2 → Gets public URL
2. Backend calls AI Service with R2 URL + metadata
3. AI Service processes with industry-specific templates
4. AI Service extracts structured Products & Services JSON
5. AI Service uploads vectors to Qdrant (background task)
6. AI Service sends webhook callback to Backend
```

**Implemented in**: `src/api/admin/products_services_routes.py`
- ✅ Complete extraction endpoint with industry templates
- ✅ Background Qdrant upload with proper error handling
- ✅ Webhook callback preparation
- ✅ Products/Services CRUD operations

### 2. IMAGE FLOW 
**Routes**: `POST /api/admin/companies/{company_id}/images/upload`

**Backend → AI Service → Qdrant Flow:**
```
1. Backend uploads image to R2 → Gets public URL
2. Backend calls AI Service with R2 URL + AI instructions
3. AI Service processes image with AI vision
4. AI Service generates embeddings for instructions
5. AI Service stores image metadata + vectors in Qdrant
6. Background AI processing for image analysis
```

**Implemented in**: `src/api/admin/image_routes.py`
- ✅ Image upload with AI instructions
- ✅ Folder management (create, update, delete)
- ✅ Image CRUD with background AI processing
- ✅ Bulk operations for folder deletion

### 3. FILE FLOW
**Routes**: File upload and tag management

**Implemented in**: `src/api/admin/file_routes.py`
- ✅ General file upload to Qdrant
- ✅ File deletion by ID or tag
- ✅ Tag-based bulk operations

### 4. COMPANY FLOW
**Routes**: Company registration and management

**Implemented in**: `src/api/admin/company_routes.py`
- ✅ Company registration with Qdrant collection creation
- ✅ Company info updates
- ✅ Company deletion with full cleanup

### FastAPI Router Integration
```python
# In src/main.py
from src.api.admin import company_routes, file_routes, products_services_routes, image_routes

app.include_router(company_routes.router, prefix="/api/admin")
app.include_router(file_routes.router, prefix="/api/admin") 
app.include_router(products_services_routes.router, prefix="/api/admin")
app.include_router(image_routes.router, prefix="/api/admin")
```
